# Holistic Approach: Smart City Project

The objective of this project is to implement a holistic approach towards a smart city that serves its citizen/government. The idea is to build an application to enhance and smoothen the process flow for various tasks involved in maintaining/running a city to provide its citizens with fundamental services especially those related to healthcare. The projects will help in easing out complex procedures for government services, and impart transparency regarding funding in different public sectors.
